# Sapce_Missions_Data_Visualization
This project is my submission for the Maven Analytics Data Visualization Challenge. Here, all the space missions and their minute details have been analyzed to extract insights that are worth the excitement for any space enthusiast. <br>

All space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission.
